# Laudato Si 105

<span style="color: black"> *There is a tendency to believe that every increase in power means “an increase of ‘progress’ itself”,
an advance in “security, usefulness, welfare and vigour; …an assimilation of new values into the stream
of culture”, as if reality, goodness and truth automatically flow from technological and economic
power as such*</span>

<span style="color: blue"> </span> Sometimes we think that technological advances will only bring positive consequences. Yet, this
is not the case. Many technological advances throughout history have brought many problems that we were not even considering.
It is up to us, the users of these new technological advances, to use utilize values to decide how to handle this tech advances.</span>

our immense technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human
responsibility, values and conscience…

<span style="color: black"> </span> Our technology is advancing at a very rapid rate, sometimes not giving us the time to think about
what will happen. We tend to focus on the present, and we forget to consider the long term effects of our decisions. We need to
give our best to try to keep up with that rapid rate, and this can be done by training people through courses like this one
or discussions regarding the ethics of this tech advances.</span>
