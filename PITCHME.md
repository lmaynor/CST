# Unintended Consequences

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color: blue"> </span>*There is a tendency to believe that every increase in power means “an increase of ‘progress’ itself”,
The fact is that “contemporary man has not been trained to use power well”, technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human values*</span>
---
<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color: blue"> </span> Sometimes we think that technological advances will only bring positive consequences. Yet, this
is not the case. Many technological advances throughout history have brought many problems that we were not even considering.
It is up to us, the users of these new technological advances, to use utilize values to decide how to handle this tech advances.

# Human Nature

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color: blue"> </span>*But human beings are not completely autonomous. Our freedom fades when it is handed over to the blind forces of the unconscious, of immediate needs, of self-interest, and of violence.*</span>
---
<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color: blue"> </span> When considering the development of fields such as AI and machine learning, it is important to consider the difficulty of defining our consciouness within human nature. Humans are susceptible to making unpopular decisions, and the ability to model this behavior will be a challenge.

# Ethical Framework

<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color: blue"> </span>*We have certain superficial mechanisms, but we cannot claim to have a sound ethics, a culture and spirituality genuinely capable of setting limits and teaching clear-minded self-restraint.*</span>
---
<span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color: blue"> </span> Efforts are being taken by the science community to mitigate the risks of unintended consequences, while working toward an ethical framework for which AI must follow. Understandably, bias will always be present, but an assumption must be made that all situations are not black and white. However, there can be a focus on the betterment of humanity, with efforts led by projects such as *OpenAI* and *OpenCog*.
